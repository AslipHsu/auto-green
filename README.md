Today you are you! That is truer than true! There is no one alive who is you-er than you!

Never idealize others. They will never live up to your expectations.

We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do.

I love my past. I love my present. I'm not ashamed of what I've had, and I'm not sad because I have it no longer.

One who gains strength by overcoming obstacles possesses the only strength which can overcome adversity.

You yourself must strive. The Buddhas only point the way.

It is in your moments of decision that your destiny is shaped.

Our greatness lies not so much in being able to remake the world as being able to remake ourselves.

Truth is generally the best vindication against slander.

Learning never exhausts the mind.
