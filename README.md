Take rest; a field that has rested gives a bountiful crop.

Wisdom is found only in truth.

Excellence is to do a common thing in an uncommon way.

It is with words as with sunbeams. The more they are condensed, the deeper they burn.

Peace is not something you wish for. It's something you make, something you do, something you are, and something you give away.

There is only one success: to be able to spend your life in your own way.

There is no great genius without some touch of madness.

Most of our pocket wisdom is conceived for the use of mediocre people, to discourage them from ambitious attempts, and generally console them in their mediocrity.

No valid plans for the future can be made by those who have no capacity for living now.

Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.
