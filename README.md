No day in which you learn something is a complete loss.

What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.

If you want things to be different, perhaps the answer is to become different yourself.

Action may not always bring happiness; but there is no happiness without action.

Adversity causes some men to break, others to break records.

When your desires are strong enough you will appear to possess superhuman powers to achieve.

Be slow to fall into friendship; but when thou art in, continue firm and constant.

Numberless are the worlds wonders, but none more wonderful than man.

Most powerful is he who has himself in his own power.

The only Zen you find on the tops of mountains is the Zen you bring up there.
