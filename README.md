Not engaging in ignorance is wisdom.

A life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable, but more useful than a life spent doing nothing.

The world cares very little about what a man or woman knows; it is what a man or woman is able to do that counts.

Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success.

Happiness is a perfume you cannot pour on others without getting a few drops on yourself.

By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.

To give oneself earnestly to the duties due to men, and, while respecting spiritual beings, to keep aloof from them, may be called wisdom.

Tragedy is a tool for the living to gain wisdom, not a guide by which to live.

Never idealize others. They will never live up to your expectations.
