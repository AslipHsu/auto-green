The greatest way to live with honor in this world is to be what we pretend to be.

My motto was always to keep swinging. Whether I was in a slump or feeling badly or having trouble off the field, the only thing to do was keep swinging.

If only wed stop trying to be happy wed have a pretty good time.

Our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we often might win, by fearing to attempt.

When we feel love and kindness toward others, it not only makes others feel loved and cared for, but it helps us also to develop inner happiness and peace.

If you're trying to create a company, it's like baking a cake. You have to have all the ingredients in the right proportion.

There are three classes of men; lovers of wisdom, lovers of honor, and lovers of gain.

We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future.

False friendship, like the ivy, decays and ruins the walls it embraces; but true friendship gives new life and animation to the object it supports.

The biggest adventure you can ever take is to live the life of your dreams.
