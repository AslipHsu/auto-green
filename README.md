Our shared values define us more than our differences. And acknowledging those shared values can see us through our challenges today if we have the wisdom to trust in them again.

Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict.

To effectively communicate, we must realize that we are all different in the way we perceive the world and use this understanding as a guide to our communication with others.

Things do not change; we change.

Men of perverse opinion do not know the excellence of what is in their hands, till someone dash it from them.

If you're trying to achieve, there will be roadblocks. I've had them; everybody has had them. But obstacles don't have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don't turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it.

Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough.

I love wisdom. And you can never be great at anything unless you love it. Not be in love with it, but love the thing, admire the thing. And it seems that if you love the thing, and you don't just want to possess it, it will find you.

Believe you can and you're halfway there.

Happiness is not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort.
