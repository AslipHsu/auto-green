When we feel love and kindness toward others, it not only makes others feel loved and cared for, but it helps us also to develop inner happiness and peace.

To follow, without halt, one aim: There is the secret of success.

The person who makes a success of living is the one who see his goal steadily and aims for it unswervingly. That is dedication.

To be fully alive, fully human, and completely awake is to be continually thrown out of the nest.

One secret of success in life is for a man to be ready for his opportunity when it comes.

One's philosophy is not best expressed in words; it is expressed in the choices one makes... and the choices we make are ultimately our responsibility.

Happiness is the reward we get for living to the highest right we know.

Love does not consist of gazing at each other, but in looking together in the same direction.

One loyal friend is worth ten thousand relatives.

You can't win unless you learn how to lose.
