When deeds and words are in accord, the whole world is transformed.

Until you make peace with who you are, you'll never be content with what you have.

I never considered a difference of opinion in politics, in religion, in philosophy, as cause for withdrawing from a friend.

A man sees in the world what he carries in his heart.

Courage is going from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm.

Let us be grateful to people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom.

Resolutely train yourself to attain peace.

I would maintain that thanks are the highest form of thought, and that gratitude is happiness doubled by wonder.

A hero is no braver than an ordinary man, but he is braver five minutes longer.

Joy is the best makeup.
