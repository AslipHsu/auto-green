Much wisdom often goes with fewer words.

If you have the guts to keep making mistakes, your wisdom and intelligence leap forward with huge momentum.

Nothing could be worse than the fear that one had given up too soon and left one unexpended effort that might have saved the world.

Problems are not stop signs, they are guidelines.

We are Divine enough to ask and we are important enough to receive.

It is a common experience that a problem difficult at night is resolved in the morning after the committee of sleep has worked on it.

Quality means doing it right when no one is looking.

Setting an example is not the main means of influencing another, it is the only means.

We are not animals. We are not a product of what has happened to us in our past. We have the power of choice.

Be sure you put your feet in the right place, then stand firm.
