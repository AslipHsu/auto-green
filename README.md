Were here for a reason. I believe a bit of the reason is to throw little torches out to lead people through the dark.

The only way to prove that you're a good sport is to lose.

Nothing could be worse than the fear that one had given up too soon and left one unexpended effort that might have saved the world.

Life is movement-we breathe, we eat, we walk, we move!

We are either progressing or retrograding all the while. There is no such thing as remaining stationary in this life.

Excellence, then, is a state concerned with choice, lying in a mean, relative to us, this being determined by reason and in the way in which the man of practical wisdom would determine it.

Every adversity, every failure, every heartache carries with it the seed of an equal or greater benefit.

First-rate people hire first-rate people; second-rate people hire third-rate people.

To enjoy life, we must touch much of it lightly.

It is more shameful to distrust our friends than to be deceived by them.
