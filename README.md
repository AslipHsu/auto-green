Read as you taste fruit or savor wine, or enjoy friendship, love or life.

Friendship is a very taxing and arduous form of leisure activity.

Perseverance is a great element of success. If you only knock long enough and loud enough at the gate, you are sure to wake up somebody.

Life is about timing.

Respect should be earned by actions, and not acquired by years.

To see things in the seed, that is genius.

We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.

There is no passion to be found playing small - in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living.

In the middle of every difficulty lies opportunity.

To climb steep hills requires a slow pace at first.
