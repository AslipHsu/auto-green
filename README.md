A really great talent finds its happiness in execution.

How far that little candle throws its beams! So shines a good deed in a naughty world.

No valid plans for the future can be made by those who have no capacity for living now.

Forgiveness is that subtle thread that binds both love and friendship. Without forgiveness, you may not even have a child one day.

The least of things with a meaning is worth more in life than the greatest of things without it.

Trouble is only opportunity in work clothes.

Great are they who see that spiritual is stronger than any material force, that thoughts rule the world.

You cannot change anything in your life with intention alone, which can become a watered-down, occasional hope that you'll get to tomorrow. Intention without action is useless.

Always be smarter than the people who hire you.

The less effort, the faster and more powerful you will be.
