Work for something because it is good, not just because it stands a chance to succeed.

The best way to pay for a lovely moment is to enjoy it.

Success is getting what you want. Happiness is wanting what you get.

I think that novels that leave out technology misrepresent life as badly as Victorians misrepresented life by leaving out sex.

Listen to what you know instead of what you fear.

Better it is to live one day seeing the rise and fall of things than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the rise and fall of things.

He can who thinks he can, and he can't who thinks he can't. This is an inexorable, indisputable law.

Think how hard physics would be if particles could think.

Those who cling to perceptions and views wander the world offending people.

All I can say about life is, Oh God, enjoy it!
