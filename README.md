Be slow of tongue and quick of eye.

There is no great genius without some touch of madness.

I have learned that friendship isn't about who you've known the longest, it's about who came and never left your side.

Wisdom has never made a bigot, but learning has.

How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.

The world turns aside to let any man pass who knows where he is going.

A failure is a man who has blundered but is not capable of cashing in on the experience.

You are a product of your environment. So choose the environment that will best develop you toward your objective. Analyze your life in terms of its environment. Are the things around you helping you toward success - or are they holding you back?

Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end.

It has never been my object to record my dreams, just to realize them.
