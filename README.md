Meaning is not what you start with but what you end up with.

Life is just a chance to grow a soul.

Friendship with oneself is all important because without it one cannot be friends with anybody else in the world.

It is not the possession of truth, but the success which attends the seeking after it, that enriches the seeker and brings happiness to him.

I have always thought the actions of men the best interpreters of their thoughts.

Happiness is not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort.

One may say the eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.

The best thing in every noble dream is the dreamer...

A wise man can learn more from a foolish question than a fool can learn from a wise answer.

Nothing but heaven itself is better than a friend who is really a friend.
