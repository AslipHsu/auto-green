I'd rather regret the things I've done than regret the things I haven't done.

Happiness does not come from doing easy work but from the afterglow of satisfaction that comes after the achievement of a difficult task that demanded our best.

You might well remember that nothing can bring you success but yourself.

Wisdom, compassion, and courage are the three universally recognized moral qualities of men.

Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off your goal.

One needs something to believe in, something for which one can have whole-hearted enthusiasm. One needs to feel that one's life has meaning, that one is needed in this world.

I never worry about action, but only inaction.

Go to your bosom: Knock there and ask your heart what it doth know.

What is new in the world? Nothing. What is old in the world? Nothing. Everything has always been and will always be.

Truth, and goodness, and beauty are but different faces of the same all.
