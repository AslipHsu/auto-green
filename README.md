Love demands infinitely less than friendship.

One's philosophy is not best expressed in words; it is expressed in the choices one makes... and the choices we make are ultimately our responsibility.

Be kind whenever possible. It is always possible.

Life is what happens while you are making other plans.

The wise man does not lay up his own treasures. The more he gives to others, the more he has for his own.

There are no failures. Just experiences and your reactions to them.

Judge nothing, you will be happy. Forgive everything, you will be happier. Love everything, you will be happiest.

Remember that sometimes not getting what you want is a wonderful stroke of luck.

Take things as they are. Punch when you have to punch. Kick when you have to kick.

Rare as is true love, true friendship is rarer.
