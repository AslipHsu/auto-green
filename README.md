Friendship, like the immortality of the soul, is too good to be believed.

Be kind whenever possible. It is always possible.

Pitching is the art of instilling fear.

You might well remember that nothing can bring you success but yourself.

Quick decisions are unsafe decisions.

The two most powerful warriors are patience and time.

No person is your friend who demands your silence or denies your right to grow.

Everyone in the world ought to do the things for which he is specially adapted. It is the part of wisdom to recognize what each one of us is best fitted for, and it is the part of education to perfect and utilize such predispositions. Because education can direct and aid nature but can never transform her.

It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages.

Good timber does not grow with ease; the stronger the wind, the stronger the trees.
