God always takes the simplest way.

True friendship multiplies the good in life and divides its evils. Strive to have friends, for life without friends is like life on a desert island... to find one real friend in a lifetime is good fortune; to keep him is a blessing.

If you were to offer a thirsty man all wisdom, you would not please him more than if you gave him a drink.

In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous.

Trust is the lubrication that makes it possible for organizations to work.

Wise men speak because they have something to say; Fools because they have to say something.

Be not afraid of greatness: some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.

Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will.

It is impossible to love and to be wise.

The universe is full of magical things, patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper.
