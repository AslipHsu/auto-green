The superior man is modest in his speech but exceeds in his actions.

If you have made mistakes, there is always another chance for you. You may have a fresh start any moment you choose.

So much technology, so little talent.

A youth, when at home, should be filial and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He should be earnest and truthful. He should overflow in love to all and cultivate the friendship of the good. When he has time and opportunity, after the performance of these things, he should employ them in polite studies.

Rock n' roll as a genre is different from pop and hip hop: it is about bands, and that for me suggests brotherhood, family, friendship and community.

The attempt to combine wisdom and power has only rarely been successful and then only for a short while.

Know, first, who you are, and then adorn yourself accordingly.

The way we communicate with others and with ourselves ultimately determines the quality of our lives.

Light tomorrow with today!

Life without love is like a tree without blossoms or fruit.
