The greatest remedy for anger is delay.

You must do the things you think you cannot do.

The beginning of knowledge is the discovery of something we do not understand.

Just as a solid rock is not shaken by the storm, even so the wise are not affected by praise or blame.

Even youngish men can acquire wisdom as time goes by.

We all grow up. Hopefully, we get wiser. Age brings wisdom, and fatherhood changes one's life completely.

In times of change, learners inherit the earth, while the learned find themselves beautifully equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists.

In skating over thin ice our safety is in our speed.

Love has no age, no limit; and no death.

I am an optimist. It does not seem too much use being anything else.
