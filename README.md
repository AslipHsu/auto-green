You cannot have what you do not want.

People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built.

The function of wisdom is to discriminate between good and evil.

The grand essentials of happiness are: something to do, something to love, and something to hope for.

We need to find the courage to say NO to the things and people that are not serving us if we want to rediscover ourselves and live our lives with authenticity.

The superior man acts before he speaks, and afterwards speaks according to his action.

Every friendship goes through ups and downs. Dysfunctional patterns set in; external situations cause internal friction; you grow apart and then bounce back together.

Does wisdom perhaps appear on the earth as a raven which is inspired by the smell of carrion?

Whoever is happy will make others happy, too.

Peace begins with a smile.
