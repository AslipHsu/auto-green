It is one of the severest tests of friendship to tell your friend his faults. So to love a man that you cannot bear to see a stain upon him, and to speak painful truth through loving words, that is friendship.

You don't choose your family. They are God's gift to you, as you are to them.

You are not here merely to make a living. You are here in order to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, with a finer spirit of hope and achievement. You are here to enrich the world, and you impoverish yourself if you forget the errand.

The mark of your ignorance is the depth of your belief in injustice and tragedy. What the caterpillar calls the end of the world, the Master calls the butterfly.

Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.

I have just three things to teach: simplicity, patience, compassion. These three are your greatest treasures.

We choose our joys and sorrows long before we experience them.

The happiness of a man in this life does not consist in the absence but in the mastery of his passions.

The difference between what we do and what we are capable of doing would suffice to solve most of the world's problems.

Setting an example is not the main means of influencing another, it is the only means.
