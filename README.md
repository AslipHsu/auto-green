In romance, we feel the need to zoom in and expound on our partner's foibles in intimate detail; in friendship, we tend to do the opposite, avoiding confrontation through fear, lethargy or both.

No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the human spirit.

He who conquers others is strong; He who conquers himself is mighty.

If you're walking down the right path and you're willing to keep walking, eventually you'll make progress.

As an elephant in the battlefield withstands arrows shot from bows all around, even so shall I endure abuse.

There is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our will.

There are two kinds of failures: those who thought and never did, and those who did and never thought.

It is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something.

Do something wonderful, people may imitate it.

If we are not fully ourselves, truly in the present moment, we miss everything.
