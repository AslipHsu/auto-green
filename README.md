You always have two choices: your commitment versus your fear.

The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.

Without courage, wisdom bears no fruit.

Be sure you put your feet in the right place, then stand firm.

We can only learn to love by loving.

Better be ignorant of a matter than half know it.

The doctor of the future will give no medicine, but will interest her or his patients in the care of the human frame, in a proper diet, and in the cause and prevention of disease.

Time is the most valuable thing a man can spend.

Success is getting what you want. Happiness is wanting what you get.

To be wrong is nothing unless you continue to remember it.
