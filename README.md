Take no thought of who is right or wrong or who is better than. Be not for or against.

Were here for a reason. I believe a bit of the reason is to throw little torches out to lead people through the dark.

Loss is nothing else but change, and change is Nature's delight.

It is easier to live through someone else than to become complete yourself.

The truth you believe and cling to makes you unavailable to hear anything new.

I'll prepare and someday my chance will come.

Happiness does not come about only due to external circumstances; it mainly derives from inner attitudes.

Success is where preparation and opportunity meet.

Failure doesn't mean you are a failure it just means you haven't succeeded yet.

The more you know yourself, the more you forgive yourself.
