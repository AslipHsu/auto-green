Nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could do only a little.

Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. And today? Today is a gift. That is why we call it the present.

Wisdom and penetration are the fruit of experience, not the lessons of retirement and leisure. Great necessities call out great virtues.

I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true. I am not bound to succeed, but I am bound to live by the light that I have. I must stand with anybody that stands right, and stand with him while he is right, and part with him when he goes wrong.

Always keep an open mind and a compassionate heart.

We choose our joys and sorrows long before we experience them.

The thing always happens that you really believe in; and the belief in a thing makes it happen.

Sometimes being a friend means mastering the art of timing. There is a time for silence. A time to let go and allow people to hurl themselves into their own destiny. And a time to prepare to pick up the pieces when it's all over.

True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life, ourselves, and the world around us.

To bring anything into your life, imagine that it's already there.
