Ignorance never settles a question.

Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.

Parents can only give good advice or put them on the right paths, but the final forming of a person's character lies in their own hands.

If one advances confidently in the direction of his dream, and endeavors to live the life which he had imagines, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.

It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves.

If you want things to be different, perhaps the answer is to become different yourself.

Positive thinking will let you do everything better than negative thinking will.

You teach best what you most need to learn.

The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today.

Tragedy is a tool for the living to gain wisdom, not a guide by which to live.
