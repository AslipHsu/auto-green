If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are heading.

If you smile when no one else is around, you really mean it.

You can't cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water.

One should not hurt others if one loves oneself.

Love yourself first and everything else falls into line. You really have to love yourself to get anything done in this world.

A youth, when at home, should be filial and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He should be earnest and truthful. He should overflow in love to all and cultivate the friendship of the good. When he has time and opportunity, after the performance of these things, he should employ them in polite studies.

Pain and foolishness lead to great bliss and complete knowledge, for Eternal Wisdom created nothing under the sun in vain.

No one has ever become poor by giving.

Acquaintances we meet, enjoy, and can easily leave behind; but friendship grows deep roots.

There is more wisdom in your body than in your deepest philosophy.
