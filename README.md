There is no duty we so underrate as the duty of being happy. By being happy we sow anonymous benefits upon the world.

Give whatever you are doing and whoever you are with the gift of your attention.

Allow the world to live as it chooses, and allow yourself to live as you choose.

Before you can inspire with emotion, you must be swamped with it yourself. Before you can move their tears, your own must flow. To convince them, you must yourself believe.

How wonderful that we have met with a paradox. Now we have some hope of making progress.

Let yourself be silently drawn by the stronger pull of what you really love.

The Superior Man is aware of Righteousness, the inferior man is aware of advantage.

Yeah, we all shine on, like the moon, and the stars, and the sun.

Life is a succession of lessons, which must be lived to be understood.

I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.
