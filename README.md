Anyone who doesn't take truth seriously in small matters cannot be trusted in large ones either.

To have faith is to trust yourself to the water. When you swim you don't grab hold of the water, because if you do you will sink and drown. Instead you relax, and float.

Character is like a tree and reputation like a shadow. The shadow is what we think of it; the tree is the real thing.

Self-trust is the first secret of success.

Once a new technology rolls over you, if you're not part of the steamroller, you're part of the road.

Every person, all the events of your life are there because you have drawn them there. What you choose to do with them is up to you.

In all chaos there is a cosmos, in all disorder a secret order.

There surely is in human nature an inherent propensity to extract all the good out of all the evil.

Nothing diminishes anxiety faster than action.

Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into a friend.
