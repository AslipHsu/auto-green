Be like the flower, turn your face to the sun.

Each day provides its own gifts.

Imagination rules the world.

It isn't what happens to us that causes us to suffer; it's what we say to ourselves about what happens.

Imagination is the living power and prime agent of all human perception.

Happiness depends upon ourselves.

If you don't know where you are going, you will probably end up somewhere else.

You can tell whether a man is clever by his answers. You can tell whether a man is wise by his questions.

The bird of paradise alights only upon the hand that does not grasp.

None knows the weight of another's burden.
