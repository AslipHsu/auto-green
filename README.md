Just as much as we see in others, we have in ourselves.

Gratitude is the fairest blossom which springs from the soul.

I am always ready to learn although I do not always like being taught.

Victory belongs to the most persevering.

The world is but a canvas to the imagination.

Can you imagine what I would do if I could do all I can?

Love is never lost. If not reciprocated, it will flow back and soften and purify the heart.

You can always tell a real friend: when you've made a fool of yourself he doesn't feel you've done a permanent job.

We could never learn to be brave and patient if there were only joy in the world.

Iron rusts from disuse; water loses its purity from stagnation... even so does inaction sap the vigor of the mind.
