We can only learn to love by loving.

The more you know yourself, the more you forgive yourself.

When you judge another, you do not define them, you define yourself.

Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others.

We must not say every mistake is a foolish one.

He who knows himself is enlightened.

Work while you have the light. You are responsible for the talent that has been entrusted to you.

What the caterpillar calls the end of the world, the master calls a butterfly.

A little more persistence, a little more effort, and what seemed hopeless failure may turn to glorious success.

If I know what love is, it is because of you.
