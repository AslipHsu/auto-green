If we could learn to like ourselves, even a little, maybe our cruelties and angers might melt away.

The trick is in what one emphasizes. We either make ourselves miserable, or we make ourselves happy. The amount of work is the same.

Wisdom has never made a bigot, but learning has.

Those who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night.

Eternal nothingness is fine if you happen to be dressed for it.

True friendship multiplies the good in life and divides its evils. Strive to have friends, for life without friends is like life on a desert island... to find one real friend in a lifetime is good fortune; to keep him is a blessing.

Value your friendship. Value your relationships.

You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life.

Neatness begets order; but from order to taste there is the same difference as from taste to genius, or from love to friendship.

I know but one freedom and that is the freedom of the mind.
