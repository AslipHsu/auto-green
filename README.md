Hope arouses, as nothing else can arouse, a passion for the possible.

Bodily exercise, when compulsory, does no harm to the body; but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind.

True silence is the rest of the mind; it is to the spirit what sleep is to the body, nourishment and refreshment.

Anything you really want, you can attain, if you really go after it.

Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom.

Beware lest you lose the substance by grasping at the shadow.

How many cares one loses when one decides not to be something but to be someone.

Neatness begets order; but from order to taste there is the same difference as from taste to genius, or from love to friendship.

If we learn to open our hearts, anyone, including the people who drive us crazy, can be our teacher.

If I know what love is, it is because of you.
