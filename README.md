There are three classes of men; lovers of wisdom, lovers of honor, and lovers of gain.

The world has the habit of making room for the man whose actions show that he knows where he is going.

Only through our connectedness to others can we really know and enhance the self. And only through working on the self can we begin to enhance our connectedness to others.

A business that makes nothing but money is a poor business.

A man cannot be said to succeed in this life who does not satisfy one friend.

Iron rusts from disuse; water loses its purity from stagnation... even so does inaction sap the vigor of the mind.

Let me tell you the secret that has led me to my goal: my strength lies solely in my tenacity.

Friendship always benefits; love sometimes injures.

All the great performers I have worked with are fueled by a personal dream.

In order to live free and happily you must sacrifice boredom. It is not always an easy sacrifice.
