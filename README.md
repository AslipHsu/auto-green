You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.

Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful.

Wisdom is found only in truth.

We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.

Ignorant men raise questions that wise men answered a thousand years ago.

Those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

We must embrace pain and burn it as fuel for our journey.

When you dance, your purpose is not to get to a certain place on the floor. It's to enjoy each step along the way.

The most important thing is transforming our minds, for a new way of thinking, a new outlook: we should strive to develop a new inner world.

What do we live for, if it is not to make life less difficult for each other?
