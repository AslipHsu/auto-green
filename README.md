Believe you can and you're halfway there.

People are not lazy. They simply have impotent goals - that is, goals that do not inspire them.

The heart has eyes which the brain knows nothing of.

Life is a progress, and not a station.

If you were to offer a thirsty man all wisdom, you would not please him more than if you gave him a drink.

Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier.

The most effective way to do it, is to do it.

Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.

Knowledge is of no value unless you put it into practice.

The free man is he who does not fear to go to the end of his thought.
