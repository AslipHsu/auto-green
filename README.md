Without hard work, nothing grows but weeds.

It requires wisdom to understand wisdom: the music is nothing if the audience is deaf.

To be wrong is nothing unless you continue to remember it.

Success is not final; failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.

One man practicing sportsmanship is far better than a hundred teaching it.

I am always doing that which I cannot do, in order that I may learn how to do it.

It is not only for what we do that we are held responsible, but also for what we do not do.

Never find fault with the absent.

The only way to have a friend is to be one.

As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.
