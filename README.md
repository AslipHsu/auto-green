Nothing is softer or more flexible than water, yet nothing can resist it.

There are three methods to gaining wisdom. The first is reflection, which is the highest. The second is limitation, which is the easiest. The third is experience, which is the bitterest.

Follow effective action with quiet reflection. From the quiet reflection will come even more effective action.

The only way to prove that you're a good sport is to lose.

Man is equally incapable of seeing the nothingness from which he emerges and the infinity in which he is engulfed.

It is not wisdom but Authority that makes a law.

Being entirely honest with oneself is a good exercise.

Music is a higher revelation than all wisdom and philosophy.

The biggest adventure you can ever take is to live the life of your dreams.

Along with success comes a reputation for wisdom.
