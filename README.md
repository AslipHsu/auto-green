As you walk in God's divine wisdom, you will surely begin to see a greater measure of victory and good success in your life.

The only Zen you find on the tops of mountains is the Zen you bring up there.

Gratitude is riches. Complaint is poverty.

The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches but reveal to them their own.

It's better to be a lion for a day than a sheep all your life.

Friendship marks a life even more deeply than love. Love risks degenerating into obsession, friendship is never anything but sharing.

Anything you really want, you can attain, if you really go after it.

The more you know yourself, the more you forgive yourself.

The least movement is of importance to all nature. The entire ocean is affected by a pebble.

To fly, we have to have resistance.
