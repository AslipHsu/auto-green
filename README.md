The truest wisdom is a resolute determination.

We must become the change we want to see.

You got to be careful if you don't know where you're going, because you might not get there.

Don't turn away from possible futures before you're certain you don't have anything to learn from them.

The more you like yourself, the less you are like anyone else, which makes you unique.

The more you care, the stronger you can be.

Finding good players is easy. Getting them to play as a team is another story.

Life's most persistent and urgent question is, 'What are you doing for others?'

By believing passionately in something that does not yet exist, we create it.

Be sure you put your feet in the right place, then stand firm.
