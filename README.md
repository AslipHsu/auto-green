I know that inner wisdom is more precious than wealth. The more you spend it, the more you gain.

This is the final test of a gentleman: his respect for those who can be of no possible value to him.

You cannot change anything in your life with intention alone, which can become a watered-down, occasional hope that you'll get to tomorrow. Intention without action is useless.

I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars.

To avoid criticism, do nothing, say nothing, be nothing.

Life is what happens while you are making other plans.

Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough.

Love at first sight is easy to understand; it's when two people have been looking at each other for a lifetime that it becomes a miracle.

Whatever you do in life, surround yourself with smart people who'll argue with you.

Time changes everything except something within us which is always surprised by change.
