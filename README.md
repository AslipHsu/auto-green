Although there may be tragedy in your life, there's always a possibility to triumph. It doesn't matter who you are, where you come from. The ability to triumph begins with you. Always.

It is the province of knowledge to speak, and it is the privilege of wisdom to listen.

Go put your creed into the deed. Nor speak with double tongue.

The person who makes a success of living is the one who see his goal steadily and aims for it unswervingly. That is dedication.

What other people may find in poetry or art museums, I find in the flight of a good drive.

Most powerful is he who has himself in his own power.

One secret of success in life is for a man to be ready for his opportunity when it comes.

Life is divided into the horrible and the miserable.

Excellence, then, is a state concerned with choice, lying in a mean, relative to us, this being determined by reason and in the way in which the man of practical wisdom would determine it.

Knowledge has three degrees: opinion, science, illumination. The means or instrument of the first is sense; of the second, dialectic; of the third, intuition.
