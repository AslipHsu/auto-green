Loyalty and friendship, which is to me the same, created all the wealth that I've ever thought I'd have.

When I dare to be powerful, to use my strength in the service of my vision, then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid.

A true friend is one who overlooks your failures and tolerates your success!

If you lose today, win tomorrow. In this never-ending spirit of challenge is the heart of a victor.

Happiness resides not in possessions, and not in gold, happiness dwells in the soul.

Friendship is one of our most treasured relationships, but it isn't codified and celebrated; it's never going to give you a party.

Fortune befriends the bold.

Do not give your attention to what others do or fail to do; give it to what you do or fail to do.

How is it possible to find meaning in a finite world, given my waist and shirt size?

Blessed is the man who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed.
