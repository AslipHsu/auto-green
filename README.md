A poem begins in delight and ends in wisdom.

I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars.

I have never been hurt by anything I didn't say.

Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.

As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.

We are all inclined to judge ourselves by our ideals; others, by their acts.

Love is rarer than genius itself. And friendship is rarer than love.

A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next week.

If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favorable.

Wisdom has its root in goodness, not goodness its root in wisdom.
