Do not waste yourself in rejection, nor bark against the bad, but chant the beauty of the good.

Every man is a damn fool for at least five minutes every day; wisdom consists in not exceeding the limit.

You can't shake hands with a clenched fist.

The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.

Wisdom ceases to be wisdom when it becomes too proud to weep, too grave to laugh, and too selfish to seek other than itself.

Life without love is like a tree without blossoms or fruit.

Love is blind; friendship closes its eyes.

Better than a thousand useless words is one useful word, upon hearing which one attains peace.

Imagination is not a talent of some men but is the health of every man.

But what is liberty without wisdom, and without virtue? It is the greatest of all possible evils; for it is folly, vice, and madness, without tuition or restraint.
