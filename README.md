There never was a good knife made of bad steel.

The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.

All difficult things have their origin in that which is easy, and great things in that which is small.

Do not give your attention to what others do or fail to do; give it to what you do or fail to do.

Iron rusts from disuse; water loses its purity from stagnation... even so does inaction sap the vigor of the mind.

If you are out to describe the truth, leave elegance to the tailor.

Never say there is nothing beautiful in the world anymore. There is always something to make you wonder in the shape of a tree, the trembling of a leaf.

The teacher who is indeed wise does not bid you to enter the house of his wisdom but rather leads you to the threshold of your mind.

You are a product of your environment. So choose the environment that will best develop you toward your objective. Analyze your life in terms of its environment. Are the things around you helping you toward success - or are they holding you back?

Dreams pass into the reality of action. From the actions stems the dream again; and this interdependence produces the highest form of living.
