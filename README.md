It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.

Never deny a diagnosis but do deny the negative verdict that may go with it.

Things do not change; we change.

Character is like a tree and reputation like a shadow. The shadow is what we think of it; the tree is the real thing.

Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.

In seed time learn, in harvest teach, in winter enjoy.

All I can say about life is, Oh God, enjoy it!

We will develop and cultivate the liberation of mind by lovingkindness, make it our vehicle, make it our basis, stabilize it, exercise ourselves in it, and fully perfect it.

We can only learn to love by loving.

Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict.
