Appreciation is the highest form of prayer, for it acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts.

'As I am, so are they; as they are, so am I.' Comparing others with oneself, do not kill nor cause others to kill.

The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page.

Hell, there are no rules here-- we're trying to accomplish something.

There is only one success - to be able to spend your life in your own way.

You're never a loser until you quit trying.

When you are content to be simply yourself and don't compare or compete, everybody will respect you.

Look back over the past, with its changing empires that rose and fell, and you can foresee the future, too.

We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures.

Your talent is God's gift to you. What you do with it is your gift back to God.
