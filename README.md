Freedom is what you do with what's been done to you.

Life has no blessing like a prudent friend.

You can always tell a real friend: when you've made a fool of yourself he doesn't feel you've done a permanent job.

A man's growth is seen in the successive choirs of his friends

I have an everyday religion that works for me. Love yourself first, and everything else falls into line.

Much wisdom often goes with fewer words.

Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier.

How is it possible that a being with such sensitive jewels as the eyes, such enchanted musical instruments as the ears, and such fabulous arabesque of nerves as the brain can experience itself anything less than a god.

In action a great heart is the chief qualification. In work, a great head.

It is only the great hearted who can be true friends. The mean and cowardly, can never know what true friendship means.
