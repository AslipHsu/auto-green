Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any one thing.

If you love life, don't waste time, for time is what life is made up of.

Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.

The grand essentials of happiness are: something to do, something to love, and something to hope for.

Without passion man is a mere latent force and possibility, like the flint which awaits the shock of the iron before it can give forth its spark.

How is it possible that a being with such sensitive jewels as the eyes, such enchanted musical instruments as the ears, and such fabulous arabesque of nerves as the brain can experience itself anything less than a god.

All wisdom does not reside in Delhi.

There are basically two types of people. People who accomplish things, and people who claim to have accomplished things. The first group is less crowded.

Work for something because it is good, not just because it stands a chance to succeed.

Adversity causes some men to break, others to break records.
