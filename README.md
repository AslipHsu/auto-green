The universe is made of stories, not atoms.

But man is not made for defeat. A man can be destroyed but not defeated.

How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.

Every person, all the events of your life are there because you have drawn them there. What you choose to do with them is up to you.

You teach best what you most need to learn.

The best way to predict your future is to create it.

Liberty, taking the word in its concrete sense, consists in the ability to choose.

Tennis is a perfect combination of violent action taking place in an atmosphere of total tranquillity.

Be sure you put your feet in the right place, then stand firm.

Look back over the past, with its changing empires that rose and fell, and you can foresee the future, too.
