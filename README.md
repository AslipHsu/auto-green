Think like a man of action; act like a man of thought.

When I dare to be powerful, to use my strength in the service of my vision, then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid.

The right way is not always the popular and easy way. Standing for right when it is unpopular is a true test of moral character.

Doing nothing is better than being busy doing nothing.

Friendship is the source of the greatest pleasures, and without friends even the most agreeable pursuits become tedious.

The language of friendship is not words but meanings.

When you see a good person, think of becoming like him. When you see someone not so good, reflect on your own weak points.

To dare is to lose ones footing momentarily. To not dare is to lose oneself.

First-rate people hire first-rate people; second-rate people hire third-rate people.

I don't need a friend who changes when I change and who nods when I nod; my shadow does that much better.
