He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not but rejoices for those which he has.

Do the difficult things while they are easy and do the great things while they are small. A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.

True friendship multiplies the good in life and divides its evils. Strive to have friends, for life without friends is like life on a desert island... to find one real friend in a lifetime is good fortune; to keep him is a blessing.

You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.

You're not obligated to win. You're obligated to keep trying to do the best you can every day.

Imagination is the highest kite one can fly.

Technology is a word that describes something that doesn't work yet.

Knowledge speaks, but wisdom listens.

In action a great heart is the chief qualification. In work, a great head.

Friendship... is not something you learn in school. But if you haven't learned the meaning of friendship, you really haven't learned anything.
