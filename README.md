Love is the master key that opens the gates of happiness.

The virtue of justice consists in moderation, as regulated by wisdom.

What makes Superman a hero is not that he has power, but that he has the wisdom and the maturity to use the power wisely. From an acting point of view, that's how I approached the part.

I will give you a definition of a proud man: he is a man who has neither vanity nor wisdom one filled with hatreds cannot be vain, neither can he be wise.

We gain the strength of the temptation we resist.

Notice that the stiffest tree is most easily cracked, while the bamboo or willow survives by bending with the wind.

Memory is the mother of all wisdom.

Sometimes being a friend means mastering the art of timing. There is a time for silence. A time to let go and allow people to hurl themselves into their own destiny. And a time to prepare to pick up the pieces when it's all over.

The greatest obstacle to connecting with our joy is resentment.

God has given you one face, and you make yourself another.
