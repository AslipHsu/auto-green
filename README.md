One needs something to believe in, something for which one can have whole-hearted enthusiasm. One needs to feel that one's life has meaning, that one is needed in this world.

Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can.

I don't need a friend who changes when I change and who nods when I nod; my shadow does that much better.

No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.

When I do good I feel good, when I do bad I feel bad, and that's my religion.

We cannot do everything at once, but we can do something at once.

The path to success is to take massive, determined action.

If you do not express your own original ideas, if you do not listen to your own being, you will have betrayed yourself.

Better be ignorant of a matter than half know it.

Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish.
