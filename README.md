Life is a succession of moments. To live each one is to succeed.

Many sophisticated, intelligent people lack wisdom and common sense.

When an opponent comes forward, move in and greet him; if he wants to pull back, send him on his way.

You are a product of your environment. So choose the environment that will best develop you toward your objective. Analyze your life in terms of its environment. Are the things around you helping you toward success - or are they holding you back?

He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose.

So long as a person is capable of self-renewal they are a living being.

Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.

A man is great by deeds, not by birth.

He has no enemies, but is intensely disliked by his friends.

He who is fixed to a star does not change his mind.
