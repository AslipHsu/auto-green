I would maintain that thanks are the highest form of thought, and that gratitude is happiness doubled by wonder.

To be wronged is nothing unless you continue to remember it.

Be faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies.

One may say the eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.

If one way be better than another, that you may be sure is nature's way.

Happiness is not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort.

Either you run the day or the day runs you.

Wrinkles should merely indicate where smiles have been.

Through perseverance many people win success out of what seemed destined to be certain failure.

It is only when the mind and character slumber that the dress can be seen.
