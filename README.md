Positive thinking will let you do everything better than negative thinking will.

It is with words as with sunbeams. The more they are condensed, the deeper they burn.

A rolling stone gathers no moss.

Wisdom ceases to be wisdom when it becomes too proud to weep, too grave to laugh, and too selfish to seek other than itself.

The past has no power to stop you from being present now. Only your grievance about the past can do that.

When you reach the end of your rope, tie a knot in it and hang on.

I will prepare and someday my chance will come.

If a man does his best, what else is there?

Only when we are no longer afraid do we begin to live.

A friend may well be reckoned the masterpiece of nature.
