The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today.

Men in general judge more from appearances than from reality. All men have eyes, but few have the gift of penetration.

No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the human spirit.

It is on our failures that we base a new and different and better success.

The best thing in every noble dream is the dreamer...

You are the only person on earth who can use your ability.

With the new day comes new strength and new thoughts.

Ask yourself the secret of your success. Listen to your answer and practice it.

Well done is better than well said.

The trouble with most people is that they think with their hopes or fears or wishes rather than with their minds.
