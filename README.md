It is the quality of our work which will please God, not the quantity.

With every experience, you alone are painting your own canvas, thought by thought, choice by choice.

Let us resolve to be masters, not the victims, of our history, controlling our own destiny without giving way to blind suspicions and emotions.

Happiness does not come from doing easy work but from the afterglow of satisfaction that comes after the achievement of a difficult task that demanded our best.

Knowledge speaks, but wisdom listens.

The ultimate promise of technology is to make us master of a world that we command by the push of a button.

All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered; the point is to discover them.

Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind.

The most complicated achievements of thought are possible without the assistance of consciousness.

If you have made mistakes, there is always another chance for you. You may have a fresh start any moment you choose.
