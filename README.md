Life's challenges are not supposed to paralyze you, they're supposed to help you discover who you are.

When in doubt, tell the truth.

Speak low, if you speak love.

True silence is the rest of the mind; it is to the spirit what sleep is to the body, nourishment and refreshment.

We know what we are but know not what we may be.

We can change our lives. We can do, have, and be exactly what we wish.

Intuition will tell the thinking mind where to look next.

Wisdom is the right use of knowledge. To know is not to be wise. Many men know a great deal and are all the greater fools for it. There is no fool so great a fool as a knowing fool. But to know how to use knowledge is to have wisdom.

The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings; the inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries.

One may say the eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.
