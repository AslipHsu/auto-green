The amount of happiness that you have depends on the amount of freedom you have in your heart.

What is necessary to change a person is to change his awareness of himself.

Change your thoughts and you change your world.

A man who doesn't trust himself can never really trust anyone else.

In order to live free and happily you must sacrifice boredom. It is not always an easy sacrifice.

The man who trusts men will make fewer mistakes than he who distrusts them.

Love demands infinitely less than friendship.

He who knows that enough is enough will always have enough.

We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.

When I was 40, my doctor advised me that a man in his 40s shouldn't play tennis. I heeded his advice carefully and could hardly wait until I reached 50 to start again.
