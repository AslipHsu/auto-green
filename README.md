Of all possessions a friend is the most precious.

It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag.

If you surrender to the wind, you can ride it.

The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.

No man is free who is not master of himself.

Let yourself be silently drawn by the stronger pull of what you really love.

The free man is he who does not fear to go to the end of his thought.

Being entirely honest with oneself is a good exercise.

To succeed, we must first believe that we can.

If a man watches three football games in a row, he should be declared legally dead.
