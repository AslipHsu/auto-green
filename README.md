But what is liberty without wisdom, and without virtue? It is the greatest of all possible evils; for it is folly, vice, and madness, without tuition or restraint.

One's life has value so long as one attributes value to the life of others, by means of love, friendship, indignation and compassion.

However rare true love may be, it is less so than true friendship.

Talent is God given. Be humble. Fame is man-given. Be grateful. Conceit is self-given. Be careful.

Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another.

You're never a loser until you quit trying.

The conditions of conquest are always easy. We have but to toil awhile, endure awhile, believe always, and never turn back.

I'm not interested in age. People who tell me their age are silly. You're as old as you feel.

Inspiration exists, but it has to find us working.

Cleverness is not wisdom.
