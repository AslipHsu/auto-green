There is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our will.

I always wanted to be somebody, but I should have been more specific.

Don't wait. The time will never be just right.

Practice yourself, for heaven's sake in little things, and then proceed to greater.

Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere.

Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing.

Focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a poverty of ambition. It asks too little of yourself. And it will leave you unfulfilled.

May our hearts garden of awakening bloom with hundreds of flowers.

Loyalty and friendship, which is to me the same, created all the wealth that I've ever thought I'd have.

Wherever you go, go with all your heart.
