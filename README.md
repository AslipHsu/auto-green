Adversity has the effect of eliciting talents, which in prosperous circumstances would have lain dormant.

One fails forward toward success.

Creativity comes from trust. Trust your instincts. And never hope more than you work.

If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door.

The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by others. Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on someone else?

Nothing strengthens authority so much as silence.

To lead people walk behind them.

Never mistake motion for action.

The important thing is this: to be able at any moment to sacrifice what we are for what we could become.

Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.
