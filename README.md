It's supposed to be automatic, but actually you have to push this button.

Two persons cannot long be friends if they cannot forgive each other's little failings.

No one has ever become poor by giving.

Never reach out your hand unless you're willing to extend an arm.

Our lives are the only meaningful expression of what we believe and in Whom we believe. And the only real wealth, for any of us, lies in our faith.

Sometimes the most important thing in a whole day is the rest we take between two deep breaths.

You can't let praise or criticism get to you. It's a weakness to get caught up in either one.

A rolling stone gathers no moss.

The final wisdom of life requires not the annulment of incongruity but the achievement of serenity within and above it.

The shoe that fits one person pinches another; there is no recipe for living that suits all cases.
