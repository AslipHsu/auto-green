I know not age, nor weariness nor defeat.

All serious daring starts from within.

I cannot even imagine where I would be today were it not for that handful of friends who have given me a heart full of joy. Let's face it, friends make life a lot more fun.

Remember that a gesture of friendship, no matter how small, is always appreciated.

No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.

No person is your friend who demands your silence or denies your right to grow.

If you lose today, win tomorrow. In this never-ending spirit of challenge is the heart of a victor.

An invincible determination can accomplish almost anything and in this lies the great distinction between great men and little men.

A friend may well be reckoned the masterpiece of nature.

Opportunity is missed by most because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.
