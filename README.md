Our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we often might win, by fearing to attempt.

The greater part of human pain is unnecessary. It is self-created as long as the unobserved mind runs your life.

Joy is what happens to us when we allow ourselves to recognize how good things really are.

Be sure you put your feet in the right place, then stand firm.

The final wisdom of life requires not the annulment of incongruity but the achievement of serenity within and above it.

Friends are the siblings God never gave us.

Let go of your attachment to being right, and suddenly your mind is more open. You're able to benefit from the unique viewpoints of others, without being crippled by your own judgement.

Goals are the fuel in the furnace of achievement.

Go put your creed into the deed. Nor speak with double tongue.

I want my friend to miss me as long as I miss him.
