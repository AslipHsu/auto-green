Every problem has a gift for you in its hands.

First-rate people hire first-rate people; second-rate people hire third-rate people.

Meditation brings wisdom, lack of meditation leaves ignorance. Know well what leads you forward and what holds you back and choose the path that leads to wisdom.

Imagination is the living power and prime agent of all human perception.

It is more shameful to distrust our friends than to be deceived by them.

Everything you can imagine is real.

Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.

Vanity can easily overtake wisdom. It usually overtakes common sense.

Speak low, if you speak love.
