Every friendship is different because everyone's personality is different.

Be as you wish to seem.

The spirit, the will to win, and the will to excel, are the things that endure. These qualities are so much more important than the events that occur.

Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is of you.

Ability is what you're capable of doing. Motivation determines what you do. Attitude determines how well you do it.

If you do not express your own original ideas, if you do not listen to your own being, you will have betrayed yourself.

How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.

Love is blind; friendship closes its eyes.

You are a product of your environment. So choose the environment that will best develop you toward your objective. Analyze your life in terms of its environment. Are the things around you helping you toward success - or are they holding you back?

Where there is great love, there are always miracles.
