The only journey is the one within.

You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.

Belief consists in accepting the affirmations of the soul; Unbelief, in denying them.

As an organizer I start from where the world is, as it is, not as I would like it to be.

Neither a lofty degree of intelligence nor imagination nor both together go to the making of genius. Love, love, love, that is the soul of genius.

Love and compassion open our own inner life, reducing stress, distrust and loneliness.

No day in which you learn something is a complete loss.

The day of fortune is like a harvest day, we must be busy when the corn is ripe.

No garden is without its weeds.

Your attitude, not your aptitude, will determine your altitude.
