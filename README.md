It's easy to make a buck. It's a lot tougher to make a difference.

Yesterday I dared to struggle. Today I dare to win.

Sometimes your joy is the source of your smile, but sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy.

Time changes everything except something within us which is always surprised by change.

I do not believe in a fate that falls on men however they act; but I do believe in a fate that falls on them unless they act.

Where there is charity and wisdom, there is neither fear nor ignorance.

The purpose of learning is growth, and our minds, unlike our bodies, can continue growing as we continue to live.

The cautious seldom err.

Nothing ever goes away until it has taught us what we need to know.

In romance, we feel the need to zoom in and expound on our partner's foibles in intimate detail; in friendship, we tend to do the opposite, avoiding confrontation through fear, lethargy or both.
