Without courage, wisdom bears no fruit.

Things do not change; we change.

Wherever you go, go with all your heart.

Whoso loves, believes the impossible.

Believe you can and you're halfway there.

Self-trust is the first secret of success.

Love is the flower you've got to let grow.

Meaning is not what you start with but what you end up with.

A goal is a dream with a deadline.

Accept the challenges so that you can feel the exhilaration of victory.
