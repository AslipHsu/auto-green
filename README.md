Time stays long enough for anyone who will use it.

Who looks outside, dreams, who looks inside, awakes.

Talent is God-given; be humble. Fame is man-given; be thankful. Conceit is self-given; be careful.

The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails.

The winds and waves are always on the side of the ablest navigators.

Intuition will tell the thinking mind where to look next.

Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love.

From wonder into wonder existence opens.

The friendship that can cease has never been real.

Hope arouses, as nothing else can arouse, a passion for the possible.
