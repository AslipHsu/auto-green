One of the advantages of being disorderly is that one is constantly making exciting discoveries.

Hell, there are no rules here-- we're trying to accomplish something.

Today you are you! That is truer than true! There is no one alive who is you-er than you!

Simply put, you believer that things or people make you unhappy, but this is not accurate. You make yourself unhappy.

Nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could do only a little.

A little more persistence, a little more effort, and what seemed hopeless failure may turn to glorious success.

The best cure for the body is a quiet mind.

A rolling stone gathers no moss.

The final wisdom of life requires not the annulment of incongruity but the achievement of serenity within and above it.
