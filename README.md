All the great performers I have worked with are fueled by a personal dream.

Leaders aren't born they are made. And they are made just like anything else, through hard work. And that's the price we'll have to pay to achieve that goal, or any goal.

If we open a quarrel between past and present, we shall find that we have lost the future.

Real success is finding your lifework in the work that you love.

If only wed stop trying to be happy wed have a pretty good time.

One's friends are that part of the human race with which one can be human.

The noblest worship is to make yourself as good and as just as you can.

All children are artists. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.

I'd rather regret the things I've done than regret the things I haven't done.

A lot of people give up just before theyre about to make it. You know you never know when that next obstacle is going to be the last one.
