Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.

If you surrender to the wind, you can ride it.

The fox has many tricks. The hedgehog has but one. But that is the best of all.

Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.

To be fully alive, fully human, and completely awake is to be continually thrown out of the nest.

He who is fixed to a star does not change his mind.

To avoid criticism, do nothing, say nothing, be nothing.

All wisdom does not reside in Delhi.

Time stays long enough for anyone who will use it.

Cherish your visions and your dreams as they are the children of your soul; the blueprints of your ultimate achievements.
