Maxim for life: You get treated in life the way you teach people to treat you.

The ballot is stronger than the bullet.

For it was not into my ear you whispered, but into my heart. It was not my lips you kissed, but my soul.

It is with words as with sunbeams. The more they are condensed, the deeper they burn.

It is not so much our friends' help that helps us, as the confidence of their help.

I cannot always control what goes on outside. But I can always control what goes on inside.

Better be wise by the misfortunes of others than by your own.

Time you enjoyed wasting was not wasted.

You can't shake hands with a clenched fist.

There never was a good knife made of bad steel.
