Love is never lost. If not reciprocated, it will flow back and soften and purify the heart.

A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong gives it a superficial appearance of being right.

Great indeed is the sublimity of the Creative, to which all beings owe their beginning, and which permeates all heaven.

Experience is simply the name we give our mistakes.

Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate.

A friend is what the heart needs all the time.

If we learn to open our hearts, anyone, including the people who drive us crazy, can be our teacher.

Dreams pass into the reality of action. From the actions stems the dream again; and this interdependence produces the highest form of living.

Wise men talk because they have something to say; fools, because they have to say something.

Friends... they cherish one another's hopes. They are kind to one another's dreams.
