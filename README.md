Never deny a diagnosis but do deny the negative verdict that may go with it.

I will give you a definition of a proud man: he is a man who has neither vanity nor wisdom one filled with hatreds cannot be vain, neither can he be wise.

When people are like each other they tend to like each other.

Love cures people - both the ones who give it and the ones who receive it.

By believing passionately in something that does not yet exist, we create it.

A tree is known by its fruit; a man by his deeds. A good deed is never lost; he who sows courtesy reaps friendship, and he who plants kindness gathers love.

Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future.

Notice that the stiffest tree is most easily cracked, while the bamboo or willow survives by bending with the wind.

Acquaintances we meet, enjoy, and can easily leave behind; but friendship grows deep roots.

Appearances are often deceiving.
