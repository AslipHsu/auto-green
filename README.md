Everything that exists is in a manner the seed of that which will be.

Friendship is Love without his wings!

Action is the foundational key to all success.

There is no way to happiness, happiness is the way.

My friends are my estate.

If we are not given the chance to forget, we are also not given the chance to recover our memories, to alter them with time, perspective, and wisdom. Forgetting, we can be ourselves beyond what the past has told us we are; we can evolve. That is the possibility we want from the future.

Nothing could be worse than the fear that one had given up too soon and left one unexpended effort that might have saved the world.

Judge nothing, you will be happy. Forgive everything, you will be happier. Love everything, you will be happiest.

It is good even for old men to learn wisdom.

A friend to all is a friend to none.
