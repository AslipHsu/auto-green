True friendship ought never to conceal what it thinks.

Let me tell you the secret that has led me to my goal: my strength lies solely in my tenacity.

The greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance - it is the illusion of knowledge.

One of the most beautiful qualities of true friendship is to understand and to be understood.

We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.

The more sand that has escaped from the hourglass of our life, the clearer we should see through it.

All our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to the understanding, and ends with reason. There is nothing higher than reason.

Kindness is the golden chain by which society is bound together.

Good advice is always certain to be ignored, but that's no reason not to give it.

A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.
