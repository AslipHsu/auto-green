The amount of happiness that you have depends on the amount of freedom you have in your heart.

What worries you masters you.

Quality means doing it right when no one is looking.

Well begun is half done.

Most folks are as happy as they make up their minds to be.

I will give you a definition of a proud man: he is a man who has neither vanity nor wisdom one filled with hatreds cannot be vain, neither can he be wise.

People may doubt what you say, but they will believe what you do.

Life is the only real counselor; wisdom unfiltered through personal experience does not become a part of the moral tissue.

A friend is a gift you give yourself.

The only journey is the one within.
