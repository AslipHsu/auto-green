Nature takes away any faculty that is not used.

There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.

Do not be embarrassed by your mistakes. Nothing can teach us better than our understanding of them. This is one of the best ways of self-education.

Much wisdom often goes with fewer words.

Love is like a friendship caught on fire. In the beginning a flame, very pretty, often hot and fierce, but still only light and flickering. As love grows older, our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals, deep-burning and unquenchable.

One today is worth two tomorrows.

The universe is made of stories, not atoms.

The doors of wisdom are never shut.

Meditation brings wisdom, lack of meditation leaves ignorance. Know well what leads you forward and what holds you back and choose the path that leads to wisdom.

Wise men make more opportunities than they find.
