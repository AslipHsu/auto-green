To do all that one is able to do, is to be a man; to do all that one would like to do, is to be a god.

How many cares one loses when one decides not to be something but to be someone.

Every man is a damn fool for at least five minutes every day; wisdom consists in not exceeding the limit.

If you do what you've always done, you'll get what you've always gotten.

As a cure for worrying, work is better than whisky.

Courage is not the absence of fear, but simply moving on with dignity despite that fear.

Fame usually comes to those who are thinking about something else.

There is nothing permanent except change.

Great are they who see that spiritual is stronger than any material force, that thoughts rule the world.

Study the past, if you would divine the future.
