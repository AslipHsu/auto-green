I can't believe that God put us on this earth to be ordinary.

Wisdom cannot come by railroad or automobile or airplane or be hurried up by telegraph or telephone.

The eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend.

Patience is the companion of wisdom.

Science investigates; religion interprets. Science gives man knowledge which is power; religion gives man wisdom which is control.

Joy is what happens to us when we allow ourselves to recognize how good things really are.

I don't want to achieve immortality through my work... I want to achieve it through not dying.

Everything in the universe goes by indirection. There are no straight lines.

Discovery consists of seeing what everybody has seen and thinking what nobody else has thought.

What is not started today is never finished tomorrow.
