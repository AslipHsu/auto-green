Difficulties are things that show a person what they are.

I have never been hurt by anything I didn't say.

People usually compare the computer to the head of the human being. I would say that hardware is the bone of the head, the skull. The semiconductor is the brain within the head. The software is the wisdom. And data is the knowledge.

To exist is to change, to change is to mature, to mature is to go on creating oneself endlessly.

Your friends will know you better in the first minute you meet than your acquaintances will know you in a thousand years.

Through pride we are ever deceiving ourselves. But deep down below the surface of the average conscience a still, small voice says to us, something is out of tune.

Along with success comes a reputation for wisdom.

Until you value yourself, you won't value your time. Until you value your time, you won't do anything with it.

Truth is powerful and it prevails.

Life is a succession of lessons, which must be lived to be understood.
