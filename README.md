Be less curious about people and more curious about ideas.

Fears are nothing more than a state of mind.

Take time to deliberate, but when the time for action has arrived, stop thinking and go in.

It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag.

Wisdom is the supreme part of happiness.

The opportunity for brotherhood presents itself every time you meet a human being.

A friend in power is a friend lost.

Happiness is found in doing, not merely possessing.

If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.

Radiate boundless love towards the entire world — above, below, and across — unhindered, without ill will, without enmity.
