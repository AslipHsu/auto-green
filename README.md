Do what you can. Want what you have. Be who you are.

Time you enjoyed wasting was not wasted.

Happiness is not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort.

To get the full value of joy you must have someone to divide it with.

The more light you allow within you, the brighter the world you live in will be.

Human beings, who are almost unique in having the ability to learn from the experience of others, are also remarkable for their apparent disinclination to do so.

The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails.

It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.

For every failure, there's an alternative course of action. You just have to find it. When you come to a roadblock, take a detour.

I'm not interested in age. People who tell me their age are silly. You're as old as you feel.
