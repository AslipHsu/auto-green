There is no greater harm than that of time wasted.

Our lives are a sum total of the choices we have made.

A man is great by deeds, not by birth.

We're born alone, we live alone, we die alone. Only through our love and friendship can we create the illusion for the moment that we're not alone.

Follow effective action with quiet reflection. From the quiet reflection will come even more effective action.

What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.

Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful.

It is not the possession of truth, but the success which attends the seeking after it, that enriches the seeker and brings happiness to him.

I will give you a definition of a proud man: he is a man who has neither vanity nor wisdom one filled with hatreds cannot be vain, neither can he be wise.

Self-trust is the first secret of success.
