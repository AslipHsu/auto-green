By nature, man hates change; seldom will he quit his old home till it has actually fallen around his ears.

My best friend is the one who brings out the best in me.

Friendship often ends in love, but love in friendship - never.

I took a speed-reading course and read 'War and Peace' in twenty minutes. It involves Russia.

I endeavor to be wise when I cannot be merry, easy when I cannot be glad, content with what cannot be mended and patient when there is no redress.

We all grow up. Hopefully, we get wiser. Age brings wisdom, and fatherhood changes one's life completely.

A successful person is one who can lay a firm foundation with the bricks that others throw at him or her.

Fame usually comes to those who are thinking about something else.

You and I are all as much continuous with the physical universe as a wave is continuous with the ocean.

Friendship with oneself is all important because without it one cannot be friends with anybody else in the world.
