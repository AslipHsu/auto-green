Difficulties increase the nearer we get to the goal.

All action results from thought, so it is thoughts that matter.

Learning is finding out what you already know.

Courage is not the absence of fear, but simply moving on with dignity despite that fear.

Just as a solid rock is not shaken by the storm, even so the wise are not affected by praise or blame.

Always remember that you are absolutely unique. Just like everyone else.

Difficulties increase the nearer we get to the goal.

The best cure for the body is a quiet mind.

Most great people have attained their greatest success just one step beyond their greatest failure.

A really great talent finds its happiness in execution.
