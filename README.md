Human beings, who are almost unique in having the ability to learn from the experience of others, are also remarkable for their apparent disinclination to do so.

Once a new technology rolls over you, if you're not part of the steamroller, you're part of the road.

Well begun is half done.

Without some goals and some efforts to reach it, no man can live.

What is not started today is never finished tomorrow.

The will to win, the desire to succeed, the urge to reach your full potential... these are the keys that will unlock the door to personal excellence.

You do not become good by trying to be good, but by finding the goodness that is already within you.

A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.
