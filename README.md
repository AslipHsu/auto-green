Sadness flies away on the wings of time.

I am a firm believer in the people. If given the truth, they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis. The great point is to bring them the real facts.

Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible.

No man was ever wise by chance.

Wherever a man turns he can find someone who needs him.

In life, all good things come hard, but wisdom is the hardest to come by.

Autumn is a second spring when every leaf is a flower.

In wartime, truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.

We need never be ashamed of our tears.

A man should look for what is, and not for what he thinks should be.
