Fame usually comes to those who are thinking about something else.

As a water bead on a lotus leaf, as water on a red lily, does not adhere, so the sage does not adhere to the seen, the heard, or the sensed.

If you have knowledge, let others light their candles in it.

TV and the Internet are good because they keep stupid people from spending too much time out in public.

Go to your bosom: Knock there and ask your heart what it doth know.

Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.

I have always thought the actions of men the best interpreters of their thoughts.

TV and the Internet are good because they keep stupid people from spending too much time out in public.

The exercise of an extraordinary gift is the supremist pleasure in life.

Never say there is nothing beautiful in the world anymore. There is always something to make you wonder in the shape of a tree, the trembling of a leaf.
