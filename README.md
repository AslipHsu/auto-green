There is never enough time to do everything, but there is always enough time to do the most important thing.

The first step to getting the things you want out of life is this: decide what you want.

It is never too late to be what you might have been.

If we are not fully ourselves, truly in the present moment, we miss everything.

When you doubt your power, you give power to your doubt.

The things that one most wants to do are the things that are probably most worth doing.

You and I are all as much continuous with the physical universe as a wave is continuous with the ocean.

Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this, that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak.

The more man meditates upon good thoughts, the better will be his world and the world at large.

Be Impeccable with Your Word. Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.
