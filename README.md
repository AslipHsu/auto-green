It is better to understand a little than to misunderstand a lot.

Love is the attempt to form a friendship inspired by beauty.

Do not wait for leaders; do it alone, person to person.

Each day provides its own gifts.

You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.

The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.

In the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures. For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.

Friendship increases in visiting friends, but in visiting them seldom.

When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

As you walk in God's divine wisdom, you will surely begin to see a greater measure of victory and good success in your life.
