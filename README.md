Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow.

No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.

The secret of getting ahead is getting started.

It's better to be a lion for a day than a sheep all your life.

It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves.

He who talks more is sooner exhausted.

Should a seeker not find a companion who is better or equal, let them resolutely pursue a solitary course.

Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.

Friendship is but another name for an alliance with the follies and the misfortunes of others. Our own share of miseries is sufficient: why enter then as volunteers into those of another?

Just trust yourself, then you will know how to live.
