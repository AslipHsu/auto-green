Meaning is not what you start with but what you end up with.

The world makes way for the man who knows where he is going.

What is a weed? A plant whose virtues have not yet been discovered.

These days people seek knowledge, not wisdom. Knowledge is of the past; wisdom is of the future.

Study the past, if you would divine the future.

The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches but reveal to them their own.

The higher we are placed, the more humbly we should walk.

The universe is transformation; our life is what our thoughts make it.

The world is but a canvas to the imagination.

God has given you one face, and you make yourself another.
