Friendship with oneself is all important, because without it one cannot be friends with anyone else in the world.

Speak when you are angry, and you will make the best speech you will ever regret.

Some people go to priests; others to poetry; I to my friends.

How many legs does a dog have if you call his tail a leg? Four. Saying that a tail is a leg doesn't make it a leg.

Let us revere, let us worship, but erect and open-eyed, the highest, not the lowest; the future, not the past!

Not what we have but what we enjoy constitutes our abundance.

To get the full value of joy you must have someone to divide it with.

A true friend is someone who is there for you when he'd rather be anywhere else.

Although there may be tragedy in your life, there's always a possibility to triumph. It doesn't matter who you are, where you come from. The ability to triumph begins with you. Always.

If you have the guts to keep making mistakes, your wisdom and intelligence leap forward with huge momentum.
