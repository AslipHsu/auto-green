Take time to deliberate, but when the time for action has arrived, stop thinking and go in.

The heart has eyes which the brain knows nothing of.

If you are bitter, you are like a dry leaf that you can just squash, and you can get blown away by the wind. There is much more wisdom in forgiveness.

Between saying and doing, many a pair of shoes is worn out.

The thoughts we choose to think are the tools we use to paint the canvas of our lives.

The greatest minds are capable of the greatest vices as well as of the greatest virtues.

God always takes the simplest way.

Do all things with love.

Applause is a receipt, not a bill.

Faith in oneself is the best and safest course.
