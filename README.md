Wisdom is a kind of knowledge. It is knowledge of the nature, career, and consequences of human values.

Success is where preparation and opportunity meet.

For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone.

But at any rate, the point is that God is what nobody admits to being, and everybody really is.

The greatest gift of life is friendship, and I have received it.

All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered; the point is to discover them.

If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done.

Love is a serious mental disease.

Real magic in relationships means an absence of judgement of others.

No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.
