You might well remember that nothing can bring you success but yourself.

Quality is never an accident; it is always the result of intelligent effort.

Imagination allows us to escape the predictable. It enables us to reply to the common wisdom that we cannot soar by saying, 'Just watch!'

Your friends will know you better in the first minute you meet than your acquaintances will know you in a thousand years.

The only way to tell the truth is to speak with kindness. Only the words of a loving man can be heard.

Beware of missing chances; otherwise it may be altogether too late someday.

It is through science that we prove, but through intuition that we discover.

Forgiveness is choosing to love. It is the first skill of self-giving love.

Where there is love there is life.

Nature takes away any faculty that is not used.
