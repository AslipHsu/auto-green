Let go of your attachment to being right, and suddenly your mind is more open. You're able to benefit from the unique viewpoints of others, without being crippled by your own judgement.

Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking.

Life is like a sewer. What you get out of it depends on what you put into it.

Perseverance is a great element of success. If you only knock long enough and loud enough at the gate, you are sure to wake up somebody.

Friendship increases in visiting friends, but in visiting them seldom.

Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow.

Nothing is softer or more flexible than water, yet nothing can resist it.

Do not wait; the time will never be 'just right.' Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you go along.

The ladder of success is never crowded at the top.

He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not but rejoices for those which he has.
