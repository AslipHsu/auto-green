The greatest mistake you can make in life is to be continually fearing you will make one.

True knowledge exists in knowing that you know nothing.

Through meditation and by giving full attention to one thing at a time, we can learn to direct attention where we choose.

Wisdom has its root in goodness, not goodness its root in wisdom.

The extreme limit of wisdom, that's what the public calls madness.

Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into a friend.

No party has a monopoly on wisdom. No democracy works without compromise.

The greatest obstacle to connecting with our joy is resentment.

Do not turn back when you are just at the goal.

A friend is what the heart needs all the time.
