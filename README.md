I have often regretted my speech, never my silence.

Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success.

Science and technology revolutionize our lives, but memory, tradition and myth frame our response.

Every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits of the world.

It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows.

Work for something because it is good, not just because it stands a chance to succeed.

There is no way to happiness, happiness is the way.

Technology is the campfire around which we tell our stories.

Success in business requires training and discipline and hard work. But if you're not frightened by these things, the opportunities are just as great today as they ever were.

The mark of your ignorance is the depth of your belief in injustice and tragedy. What the caterpillar calls the end of the world, the Master calls the butterfly.
