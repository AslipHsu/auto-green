Kind words can be short and easy to speak, but their echoes are truly endless.

Go put your creed into the deed. Nor speak with double tongue.

Hope arouses, as nothing else can arouse, a passion for the possible.

He who hath many friends hath none.

The price of greatness is responsibility.

Happiness often sneaks in through a door you didn't know you left open.

Age does not protect you from love. But love, to some extent, protects you from age.

Friendship multiplies the good of life and divides the evil.

I never considered a difference of opinion in politics, in religion, in philosophy, as cause for withdrawing from a friend.

Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love.
