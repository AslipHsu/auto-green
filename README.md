Always remember that you are absolutely unique. Just like everyone else.

What is necessary to change a person is to change his awareness of himself.

Change your life today. Don't gamble on the future, act now, without delay.

Yesterday's home runs don't win today's games.

A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.

Sorrow is knowledge, those that know the most must mourn the deepest, the tree of knowledge is not the tree of life.

Although there may be tragedy in your life, there's always a possibility to triumph. It doesn't matter who you are, where you come from. The ability to triumph begins with you. Always.

Business, you know, may bring you money, but friendship hardly ever does.

Irrigators channel waters; fletchers straighten arrows; carpenters bend wood; the wise master themselves.

The extreme limit of wisdom, that's what the public calls madness.
