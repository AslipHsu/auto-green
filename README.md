I allow my intuition to lead my path.

A lot of times people look at the negative side of what they feel they can't do. I always look on the positive side of what I can do.

A youth, when at home, should be filial and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He should be earnest and truthful. He should overflow in love to all and cultivate the friendship of the good. When he has time and opportunity, after the performance of these things, he should employ them in polite studies.

I believe that we are solely responsible for our choices, and we have to accept the consequences of every deed, word, and thought throughout our lifetime.

A friend is what the heart needs all the time.

No alibi will save you from accepting the responsibility.

Iron rusts from disuse; water loses its purity from stagnation... even so does inaction sap the vigor of the mind.

The shoe that fits one person pinches another; there is no recipe for living that suits all cases.

A true friend is the greatest of all blessings, and that which we take the least care of all to acquire.

The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen, nor touched... but are felt in the heart.
