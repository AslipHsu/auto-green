If you don't go after what you want, you'll never have it. If you don't ask, the answer is always no. If you don't step forward, you're always in the same place.

Setting an example is not the main means of influencing another, it is the only means.

It is fatal to enter any war without the will to win it.

Make the best use of what is in your power and take the rest as it happens.

The final wisdom of life requires not the annulment of incongruity but the achievement of serenity within and above it.

Life is a learning experience, only if you learn.

If you want your life to be more rewarding, you have to change the way you think.

Does wisdom perhaps appear on the earth as a raven which is inspired by the smell of carrion?

The longer we dwell on our misfortunes, the greater is their power to harm us.

Blessed are the hearts that can bend; they shall never be broken.
