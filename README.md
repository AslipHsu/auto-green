Be the change that you want to see in the world.

Our lives are the only meaningful expression of what we believe and in Whom we believe. And the only real wealth, for any of us, lies in our faith.

He who knows, does not speak. He who speaks, does not know.

In rivers, the water that you touch is the last of what has passed and the first of that which comes; so with present time.

Before you put on a frown, make absolutely sure there are no smiles available.

Courage is rightly esteemed the first of human qualities... because it is the quality which guarantees all others.

If you break your neck, if you have nothing to eat, if your house is on fire, then you got a problem. Everything else is inconvenience.

Friendship is almost always the union of a part of one mind with the part of another; people are friends in spots.

True happiness means forging a strong spirit that is undefeated, no matter how trying our circumstances.

Get busy living or get busy dying.
