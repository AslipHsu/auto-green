There are three classes of men; lovers of wisdom, lovers of honor, and lovers of gain.

A fine quotation is a diamond on the finger of a man of wit, and a pebble in the hand of a fool.

If you don't know where you are going, you will probably end up somewhere else.

You need chaos in your soul to give birth to a dancing star.

The beginning of wisdom is found in doubting; by doubting we come to the question, and by seeking we may come upon the truth.

All our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to the understanding, and ends with reason. There is nothing higher than reason.

As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.

Life is just a chance to grow a soul.

Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.

What is past is left behind. The future is yet unreached. Whatever quality is present, clearly see it right there.
