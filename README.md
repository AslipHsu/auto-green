Anticipate the difficult by managing the easy.

It is important to our friends to believe that we are unreservedly frank with them, and important to friendship that we are not.

He who learns must suffer. And even in our sleep pain that cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, and in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom to us by the awful grace of God.

A tree is known by its fruit; a man by his deeds. A good deed is never lost; he who sows courtesy reaps friendship, and he who plants kindness gathers love.

Pain and foolishness lead to great bliss and complete knowledge, for Eternal Wisdom created nothing under the sun in vain.

A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.

Nature is a mutable cloud which is always and never the same.

The more sand that has escaped from the hourglass of our life, the clearer we should see through it.

Love and friendship exclude each other.

If we look at the world with a love of life, the world will reveal its beauty to us.
