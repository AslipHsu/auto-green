Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart.

A quarrel between friends, when made up, adds a new tie to friendship.

People take different roads seeking fulfilment and happiness. Just because they're not on your road doesn't mean they've gotten lost.

Kindness is more important than wisdom, and the recognition of this is the beginning of wisdom.

Whatever we expect with confidence becomes our own self-fulfilling prophecy.

I am like a falling star who has finally found her place next to another in a lovely constellation, where we will sparkle in the heavens forever.

Excellence is to do a common thing in an uncommon way.

Of all possessions a friend is the most precious.

Sustaining true friendship is a lot more challenging than we give it credit for.

Just as a flower, which seems beautiful has color but no perfume, so are the fruitless words of a man who speaks them but does them not.
