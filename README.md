A fine quotation is a diamond on the finger of a man of wit, and a pebble in the hand of a fool.

The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime.

Just as a solid rock is not shaken by the storm, even so the wise are not affected by praise or blame.

There is no passion to be found playing small - in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living.

Don't wait. The time will never be just right.

There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.

Keep yourself to the sunshine and you cannot see the shadow.

Wisdom is nothing but a preparation of the soul, a capacity, a secret art of thinking, feeling and breathing thoughts of unity at every moment of life.

The greatest remedy for anger is delay.

The first duty of a human being is to assume the right functional relationship to society - more briefly, to find your real job, and do it.
