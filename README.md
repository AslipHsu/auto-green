He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not but rejoices for those which he has.

His lack of education is more than compensated for by his keenly developed moral bankruptcy.

Through pride we are ever deceiving ourselves. But deep down below the surface of the average conscience a still, small voice says to us, something is out of tune.

The essence of true friendship is to make allowance for another's little lapses.

Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.

A man is not old as long as he is seeking something.

In all chaos there is a cosmos, in all disorder a secret order.

Intuition will tell the thinking mind where to look next.

No matter how carefully you plan your goals they will never be more than pipe dreams unless you pursue them with gusto.

No distance of place or lapse of time can lessen the friendship of those who are thoroughly persuaded of each other's worth.
