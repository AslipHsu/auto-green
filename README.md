There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.

Your mind will answer most questions if you learn to relax and wait for the answer.

The more man meditates upon good thoughts, the better will be his world and the world at large.

It is impossible to escape the impression that people commonly use false standards of measurement â€” that they seek power, success and wealth for themselves and admire them in others, and that they underestimate what is of true value in life.

When you see a good person, think of becoming like him. When you see someone not so good, reflect on your own weak points.

Go for it now. The future is promised to no one.

No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the human spirit.

Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.

Aim for the moon. If you miss, you may hit a star.

Time you enjoyed wasting was not wasted.
