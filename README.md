The least movement is of importance to all nature. The entire ocean is affected by a pebble.

Knowledge speaks, but wisdom listens.

The doctor of the future will give no medicine, but will interest her or his patients in the care of the human frame, in a proper diet, and in the cause and prevention of disease.

When a thing is done, it's done. Don't look back. Look forward to your next objective.

On every thorn, delightful wisdom grows, in every rill a sweet instruction flows.

The greatest part of our happiness depends on our dispositions, not our circumstances.

There is no great genius without some touch of madness.

Time changes everything except something within us which is always surprised by change.

Respect should be earned by actions, and not acquired by years.

There is no great genius without some touch of madness.
