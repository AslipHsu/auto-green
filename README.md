Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.

An economist is an expert who will know tomorrow why the things he predicted yesterday didn't happen today.

Success is getting what you want. Happiness is wanting what you get.

Some do not understand that we must die, But those who do realize this settle their quarrels.

The World is my country, all mankind are my brethren, and to do good is my religion.

Change in all things is sweet.

As a water bead on a lotus leaf, as water on a red lily, does not adhere, so the sage does not adhere to the seen, the heard, or the sensed.

The person who lives life fully, glowing with life's energy, is the person who lives a successful life.

No work or love will flourish out of guilt, fear, or hollowness of heart, just as no valid plans for the future can be made by those who have no capacity for living now.

The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today.
