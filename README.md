Those that know, do. Those that understand, teach.

The future is completely open, and we are writing it moment to moment.

Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.

I'm a great believer in luck and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it.

The beginning of wisdom is found in doubting; by doubting we come to the question, and by seeking we may come upon the truth.

When you see a good person, think of becoming like him. When you see someone not so good, reflect on your own weak points.

The way we communicate with others and with ourselves ultimately determines the quality of our lives.

People take different roads seeking fulfilment and happiness. Just because they're not on your road doesn't mean they've gotten lost.

The least movement is of importance to all nature. The entire ocean is affected by a pebble.

The greatest minds are capable of the greatest vices as well as of the greatest virtues.
