Truth, and goodness, and beauty are but different faces of the same all.

The sum of wisdom is that time is never lost that is devoted to work.

No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible.

I'm a great believer in luck and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it.

Listen to what you know instead of what you fear.

Goals are the fuel in the furnace of achievement.

Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach him how to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.

The world turns aside to let any man pass who knows where he is going.

To choose what is difficult all one's days, as if it were easy, that is faith.

There are many ways of going forward, but only one way of standing still.
