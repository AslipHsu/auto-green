Before you can inspire with emotion, you must be swamped with it yourself. Before you can move their tears, your own must flow. To convince them, you must yourself believe.

Do not follow where the path may lead. Go, instead, where there is no path and leave a trail.

Always keep your mind as bright and clear as the vast sky, the great ocean, and the highest peak, empty of all thoughts. Always keep your body filled with light and heat. Fill yourself with the power of wisdom and enlightenment.

And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.

Life is just a chance to grow a soul.

Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.

Both formerly and now, it is only suffering that I describe, and the cessation of suffering.

Strong people make as many mistakes as weak people. Difference is that strong people admit their mistakes, laugh at them, learn from them. That is how they become strong.

To succeed, we must first believe that we can.

When you are content to be simply yourself and don't compare or compete, everybody will respect you.
